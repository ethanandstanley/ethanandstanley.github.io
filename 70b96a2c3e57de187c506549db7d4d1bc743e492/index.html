      <p class="text-start">We are so excited to be dads! Turns out, it’s kinda tricky for two guys to have a baby. So, we are looking to our community of family, friends, and friends-of-friends to see if we can connect with a really amazing, really generous person who’s willing to help us make our dream of having a baby come true by being our Surrogate.</p>
    <br/>

      <span class="bold">About Us</span> 
      <p class="text">We met 10 years ago at a party where Stanley was singing and Ethan was secretly recording the concert! On our first date, Ethan revealed that he had a playlist from that night and Stanley revealed that he had been stalking Ethan on Facebook while he was in grad school. Talent crushes quickly grew into deep admiration and love, and 7 years later to the day we got married in the Berkshire mountains under a grove of birch trees.</p>

      <p class="text">Ethan grew up in Washington, DC, has three terrific sisters, and has lived on the east coast his whole life. Stanley grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and has a large extended family including a brother and sister-in-law who have adorable twin girls. We love to travel (Italy, China, Mexico…), play tennis, host BBQs with friends, and binge watch RuPaul’s Drag Race. We both love and work in the arts. Stanley is a performer who was in three Broadway shows and a really fun comedy on Netflix. Now he runs a production company and helps nonprofits plan events. Ethan is co-founder of Heartbeat Opera, known for radically re-envisioning the classics, and has just accepted a new role as Associate Artistic Director at a theatre in DC. We are so excited to be in Ethan’s hometown and take this next step in our life together: a baby!</p>

  <span class="bold">About You</span>
    <p class="text" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Being a surrogate is a tremendous act of generosity. The wonderwomen who offer to carry a pregnancy for someone else are incredibly loving, strong, and altruistic humans. We know that, most of all, our surrogate will be someone who believes in her heart that she wants to help us – two gay guys – have a child. With our surrogacy agency, we will do everything we can to support our surrogate through the process, providing emotional guidance with a social worker, legal support, and financial compensation. </p>
